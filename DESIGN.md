Frameworks Used: 
* LiveData
* MVVM using ViewModel
* Retrofit for services
* Picasso for network image loading
* AndroidX Test & Espresso

Stretch goals:
1. Dagger - dependency injection to make writing tests easier and future extension of the code
2. Cache Service Responses - some form of repository for caching service responses on device for
some amount of time to prevent calling the services multiple times. 
3. Maybe, MAYBE DataBinding - it's given me problems in the past but could be fun.
3. Carts/wishlists - could use something like Room to cache on device.
4. Theme the progress bar as Target (maybe use animations), same for image placeholders.
